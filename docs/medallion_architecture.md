# Medallion Architecture

The medallion architecture is a data design pattern used in Databricks to organize data into different layers, each with a specific purpose and level of refinement. This document explains the medallion architecture as implemented in the DAB ETL Framework.

## Overview

The medallion architecture organizes data into three layers, often referred to as bronze, silver, and gold:

```
Raw Data → Bronze → Silver → Gold → Analytics
```

Each layer represents a different level of data refinement and serves a different purpose:

- **Bronze**: Raw data ingestion
- **Silver**: Cleaned and validated data
- **Gold**: Business-ready data

## Bronze Layer

The bronze layer is the entry point for data into the lakehouse. It represents the raw data ingested from various sources with minimal transformations.

### Characteristics

- **Raw Data**: Data is stored in its original form or with minimal transformations
- **Complete**: All data is preserved, including potentially erroneous or incomplete records
- **Immutable**: Data is not modified after ingestion
- **Metadata Enriched**: Additional metadata is added, such as ingestion timestamp and source information

### Purpose

- Provide a historical record of all data ingested
- Enable reprocessing of data if needed
- Serve as a foundation for the silver layer

### Implementation in DAB ETL Framework

In the DAB ETL Framework, the bronze layer is implemented in the `bronze_layer.py` notebook. This notebook:

- Reads data from a source (e.g., CSV file, streaming source, JDBC source)
- Adds metadata columns (`_ingest_timestamp`, `_source`)
- Writes the data to a Delta table

## Silver Layer

The silver layer contains cleaned, validated, and transformed data from the bronze layer. It represents a more refined version of the data.

### Characteristics

- **Cleaned**: Data is cleaned and standardized
- **Validated**: Data quality checks are applied
- **Transformed**: Business rules and transformations are applied
- **Structured**: Data is organized into a well-defined schema
- **Queryable**: Data is optimized for querying

### Purpose

- Provide a clean and validated version of the data
- Serve as a foundation for the gold layer
- Enable data exploration and ad-hoc analysis

### Implementation in DAB ETL Framework

In the DAB ETL Framework, the silver layer is implemented in the `silver_layer.py` notebook. This notebook:

- Reads data from the bronze layer
- Applies data quality expectations
- Cleans and standardizes the data
- Converts data types
- Adds silver layer metadata
- Writes the data to a Delta table

## Gold Layer

The gold layer contains business-ready data that is optimized for consumption by end users, dashboards, and applications. It represents the most refined version of the data.

### Characteristics

- **Aggregated**: Data is aggregated and summarized
- **Denormalized**: Data is denormalized for easier querying
- **Business-Ready**: Data is organized according to business concepts
- **Optimized**: Data is optimized for specific use cases

### Purpose

- Provide business-ready data for consumption
- Enable self-service analytics
- Support dashboards and applications

### Implementation in DAB ETL Framework

In the DAB ETL Framework, the gold layer is implemented in the `gold_layer.py` notebook. This notebook:

- Reads data from the silver layer
- Creates dimension and fact tables
- Applies aggregations and business logic
- Adds gold layer metadata
- Writes the data to Delta tables

## Benefits of the Medallion Architecture

The medallion architecture provides several benefits:

- **Separation of Concerns**: Each layer has a specific purpose and responsibility
- **Data Quality**: Data quality is enforced at each layer
- **Reprocessing**: Data can be reprocessed from any layer if needed
- **Governance**: Data lineage and governance are built into the architecture
- **Performance**: Each layer is optimized for its specific purpose
- **Scalability**: The architecture scales with the size and complexity of the data

## Conclusion

The medallion architecture is a powerful pattern for organizing data in a lakehouse. By separating data into bronze, silver, and gold layers, it provides a clear path from raw data to business-ready insights.

The DAB ETL Framework implements the medallion architecture using Delta Live Tables, providing a scalable, maintainable, and reliable solution for ETL pipelines.
